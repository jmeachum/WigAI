# Epic 5: Enhance MCP `status` Command

## 1. Goal

To significantly enhance the `status` MCP command by providing a more comprehensive snapshot of the current Bitwig Studio state. This will give AI agents richer context, enabling more informed decisions and sophisticated interactions with the Bitwig environment.

## 2. Background

The existing `status` command returns minimal information (WigAI version and operational status). To allow for more intelligent agent behavior, it needs to convey key aspects of the Bitwig project, transport, selected track, selected clip slot, and selected device, including their parameters. This enhancement is inspired by the detailed information available via Bitwig's OSC interface.

## 3. User Stories

This epic will be broken down into the following stories:

*   **Story 5.1: Core Project and Transport Status**
    *   As an AI agent, I want to retrieve the current project name and audio engine status, so I can confirm I'm working in the correct project and that audio is active.
    *   As an AI agent, I want to know the current transport state (playing, recording, tempo, time signature, beat/time position), so I can synchronize my actions with Bitwig's playback.
*   **Story 5.2: Selected Track and Project Parameters Status**
    *   As an AI agent, I want to access global project parameters, so I can read or potentially suggest modifications to them.
    *   As an AI agent, I want to get information about the currently selected track (index, name, type, mute/solo/arm status), so I can perform track-specific operations.
*   **Story 5.3: Selected Device Status and Parameters**
    *   As an AI agent, I want to get information about the currently selected device (track context, device index, name, bypass status, and its parameters), so I can understand and control the selected device.
*   **Story 5.4: Selected Clip Slot Status**
    *   As an AI agent, I want to get information about the currently selected clip slot (track context, slot/scene indices, names, content status, playback/recording states), so I can interact with clips in the session view.

## 4. Proposed Solution

Modify the `StatusTool.java` to gather additional information from the Bitwig Studio API and return it in an expanded JSON structure. The MCP `status` command will no longer have a top-level `status` or `message` field from the tool's direct response; these will be handled by the MCP protocol wrapper if necessary. The `wigai_version` will remain.

### Proposed JSON Response for `status` Command:

```json

      },
      {

        "name": null,
        "value": null,
        "raw_value": null,
        "display_value": null
      }
      // ... up to 8 device remote controls
      // Only 'name', 'value', 'raw_value', 'display_value' are null if 'exists' is false.
    ]
  }
}
```

### Remote-Control Schema (Status Command Internal Definition)

This epic defines the single source of truth for how selected-device controls are exposed via the `status` payload:

- **parameters**: always an 8-element array ordered by remote-control slot (0–7) on the currently selected page.
  - `index` *(integer)* – slot index.
  - `exists` *(boolean)* – `true` if Bitwig reports an assigned parameter for that slot.
  - `name` *(string, nullable)* – parameter label when available.
  - `value` *(float, nullable)* – normalized value in range `0.0–1.0`.
  - `raw_value` *(float, nullable)* – native value from Bitwig when exposed, otherwise `null`.
  - `display_value` *(string, nullable)* – text Bitwig shows for the control.
- Slots with `exists=false` must still be included so downstream agents can rely on fixed ordering.

## 5. Technical Considerations

*   The `StatusTool.java` will need to interface with various parts of the Bitwig Studio Java API (Application, Project, Transport, Track, Device, ClipLauncherSlotBank, etc.) to retrieve the required information.
*   For `selected_device.parameters`, use the primary `RemoteControlBank` on the selected device and apply the schema defined above. No other artifact governs that shape.
*   Care must be taken to handle cases where information might be unavailable (e.g., no device selected, no clip slot selected, project parameters not configured). In such cases, relevant fields should be `null` or an empty array `[]` for lists.
*   The `value` for parameters should be normalized (0.0-1.0) where applicable, consistent with `get_selected_device_parameters`. `display_value` will provide the formatted string. `raw_value` provides the native, unnormalized value.
*   Indices (`track_index`, `slot_index`, `scene_index`, `device.index`) should be 0-based.
*   The `api-reference.md` will need to be updated to reflect these changes to the `status` command's response.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

*   The `status` MCP command returns a JSON object matching the structure defined above.
*   All fields in the JSON response accurately reflect the current state of Bitwig Studio.
*   The `selected_device.parameters` array in the response correctly represents the 8 remote controls of the selected device's current page, using the schema defined in this epic (index, exists, name, value, raw_value, display_value).
*   The `StatusTool.java` correctly queries the Bitwig API for all required data points.
*   The `api-reference.md` is updated with the new response format for the `status` command.
*   The changes are thoroughly tested for various Bitwig project states (e.g., empty project, project with content, different selections).
*   The tool gracefully handles scenarios where parts of the requested information are not available (e.g., no device selected, an empty clip slot selected).

## 7. Out of Scope for this Epic

*   Adding new MCP commands to modify these states (they are covered by other tools or future epics).
*   Fetching exhaustive lists of all tracks, scenes, or devices (these would be separate, more specific tools).
*   Real-time event streaming of state changes (this `status` command is a poll/request-response).
